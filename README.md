# Theme helper

This repository has some tools to help with FusionAuth theme management. More about FusionAuth themes: https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/themes/

This repository is for helping you edit, develop and manage FusionAuth themes.

## Prerequisites

* curl
* node
* npm
* jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq

## Installation

* `npm install`
* update `.env.sample` with your API key, FusionAuth hostname, and theme id and copy it to `.env`
* you can modify the TMP_DIR to be whereever you'd like it to be, the default is `tmp` in the current directory.

The API key must have `/api/theme` permissions, at least `GET` and `PATCH`.

## Usage

Run `download.sh` to pull down all the freemarker files.

Commit them to version control.

In a separate terminal, run `npm run watch`. This will upload any modified templates.

Edit the files using whatever local editor you want.

In the browser, reload the themed pages and see your changes live.

When done, commit changes to version control.

You can do a final upload of whatever is in the TMP_DIR by running `upload.sh`.

## TODO

Have the stylesheet and messages files handled as well. Only templates and default messages are supported currently.
